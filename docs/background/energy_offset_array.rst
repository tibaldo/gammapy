EnergyOffset Array
==================

The `~gammapy.background.EnergyOffsetArray` class represents a 2D array *(energy,offset)* that is filled with an eventlist.
For a set of observations, by giving an energy binning and an offset binning, you fill the events in this histogram.


Four Crab observations are located in the ``gammapy-extra`` repository as examples:
`hess_events_simulated_023523.fits`_ , `hess_events_simulated_023526.fits`_ , `hess_events_simulated_023559.fits`_ and `hess_events_simulated_023592.fits`_

An example script of how to fill this array from these four observations and plots the result is given in the ``examples`` directory:
:download:`example_energy_offset_array.py <../../examples/example_energy_offset_array.py>`
