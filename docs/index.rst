What is Gammapy?
----------------

Gammapy is a community-developed, open-source Python package for gamma-ray astronomy.

* Read the `Gammapy documentation`_.
* Ask questions on the `Gammapy mailing list`_.
* Request features, report bugs or contribute on the `Gammapy GitHub page`_.

To learn more about Gammapy, have a look at the :ref:`about` page, which includes
a link to the Gammapy proceeding from ICRC 2015.

Gammapy works with Python 2 and 3, on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows and is easy to

Once you have it running, we suggest you head over to the 5 minute :ref:`getting-started` tutorial.
