Introduction
============
`gammapy.spectrum` holds functions and classes related to 1D region based spectral analysis.

The basic of this type of analysis are explained in `this <https://github.com/gammapy/PyGamma15/tree/gh-pages/talks/analysis-classical>`__ talk

TODO: explain basics

A good reference for the forward-folding on-off likelihood fitting methods
is Section 7.5 "Spectra and Light Curves" in [Naurois2012]_,
in publications usually the reference [Piron2001]_ is used.
A standard reference for the unfolding method is [Albert2007]_.
